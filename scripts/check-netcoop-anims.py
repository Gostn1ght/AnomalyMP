"""Third-person animations (owner 2026-10-10, doc 90 §4): the overlay's OMF
files (GAMMA's motions with xAGNA/xrMPE motion data merged in by
scripts/tools/merge-player-anims.py) are well-formed: every motion
definition has its motion data at its index, under its name; stalker_animation
keeps GAMMA's device, PDA, binocular and eating motions; partitions are the
stalker skeleton's. xAGNA's configs do not change NPC behaviour: no movement
speeds, no fire/shell points (NPC shots stay GAMMA's). Device poses
(xrRazom's xrMPE set, modded_stalker_animations): only xrr_ names (nothing
shadows GAMMA's motions), held-up poses for a flashlight/glow stick and
detector poses for every hand combination; the engine picks them by device."""
